// For the tasks in this file, please see Rectangle.java as an example.

// Task 1: make Triangle inherit from Shape.
// Task 2: implement all functions that Triangle must inherit from the Shape interface.
//         Note that Triangle should have three instance variables corresponding to
//         side length 1, side length 2, side length 3.
//         Additionally, note that you can find the area of a triangle given 3 side lengths
//         using Heron's formula: h
public class Triangle {
}
