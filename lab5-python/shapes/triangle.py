# For the tasks in this file, please see Rectangle.java as an example.

# Task 1: make Triangle inherit from Shape.
# Task 2: implement all functions that Triangle should implement from Shape.
#         Note that Triangle should have three instance variables corresponding to
#         side length 1, side length 2, side length 3.
#         Additionally, note that you can find the area of a triangle given 3 side lengths
#         using Heron's formula: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula
